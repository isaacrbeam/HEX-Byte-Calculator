# HEX-Byte-Calculator
Tool to help determine how many HEX bytes are selected. 

Try it out:

HEX payload sample:
53 47 56 73 62 47 38 67 56 32 39 79 62 47 51 68

Then converts to Decmial, ASCii. Additional tool of base64 encode and decode was added to help if needed. This tool is great for packet cyber challenges knowing that a payload message is x bytes without the need to manually count. 

Many of tweaks are needed but it is out there in case someone need to use it. Very light as it is jQuery and HTML. If time permits over the next year I hope to improve the code, and add additional features.
